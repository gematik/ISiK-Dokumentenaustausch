  "code": "generate-metadata",
  "comment": "\r\n    Expected behaviour:\r\nServer SHALL create DocumentReference Resources from the Bundle provided through the 'fhir.document' parameter by \r\n mapping the metadata fields from the Composition in the document Bundle according to the [Composition-DocumentReference.Mapping](http://hl7.org/fhir/composition-mappings.html#fhirdocumentreference)\r\n Additionally, the Server SHALL attempt to match the target of Composition.subject to an existing Resource on it's own endpoint\r\n and populate DocumentReference.subject.reference acordingly.\r\nIf no matching target id found, the Server SHALL reply with HTTP 412 (precondition failed) and return an OperationOutcome\r\n\r\nServers MAY attempt to resolve additional references, such as Composition.author, Composition.encounter etc.\r\n\r\nServers MAY allow clients to redirect any attempts to find matches to another endpoint. This is especially helpful, \r\nwhen the $generate-metadata operation is provided by a third party other than the document's intended destination.\r\n\r\nServers MAY offer additional mapping services for non-fhir-documents although these may need more advances business logic,\r\nterminology mapping services and complex patient matching. If they offer additional non-fhir mapping capabilities, \r\nServers SHOULD expose a derived OperationDefinition in their CapabilityStatment, which clearly defines the acceptable `non-fhir-document-types`.\r\n\r\nClients SHOULD populate `non-fhir-document-type` with a code acceptable to the server, when submitting `non-fhir-document`s\r\n",
