  "comment": "\n    Expected behaviour:\n* Servers SHALL store the submitted binary with the associated metadata and make it available through the FHIR API\n* If the submission contains a structured FHIR document-Bundle, Servers MAY chose to store additional representations of the document,\ne.g. native FHIR (XML and/or JSON) for FHIR aware Clients and/or an HTML-Document representing the document's narrative to allow easy read access for FHIR agnostic clients. \nThe Binary representation mostly serves the purpose of archiving an immutable version of the document, rather than making it available to other consumers!\nIf Servers can provide multiple representations of the same document, this SHOULD be reflected in multiple `content`-elements in the DocumentReference with the respective mime-type.\n* If a Client submits a DocumentReference which includes a `relatesTo`-Element, the Server SHALL process the submission in accordance with `relatesTo.code` as either a \nreplacement, transformation, appendix or a signature of the document referenced in `relatesTo.target`. If applicable, Servers SHALL update \nthe `status` of the related DocumentReference to `superseded`. \n* Servers SHALL return HTTP 412 (precondition failed) the `relatesTo.target` reference does not resolve on the server.\n* Servers SHALL ignore any information submitted by the Client in `DocumentReference.content.attachment.url` and assume the content to be the Binary submitted with the `payload`parameter.\n* Servers SHALL adjust the `content`-element to reflect how and where the document has been stored by the server.\n",
