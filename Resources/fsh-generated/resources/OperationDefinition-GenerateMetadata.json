  "purpose": "Using Operations instead of transaction Bundles allows for refined server side \n    logic beyond create/update to occur and simplifies client control",
  "code": "generate-metadata",
  "comment": "\n    Expected behaviour:\n* Servers SHALL create DocumentReference Resources from the Bundle provided through the 'fhir.document' parameter by \n mapping the metadata fields from the Composition in the document Bundle according to the [Composition-DocumentReference.Mapping](http://hl7.org/fhir/composition-mappings.html#fhirdocumentreference)\n* Servers SHALL attempt to match the target of Composition.subject to an existing Resource on it's own endpoint\n and populate DocumentReference.subject.reference accordingly.\n* If no matching target id found, the Server SHALL reply with HTTP 412 (precondition failed) and return an OperationOutcome\n\n* Servers MAY attempt to resolve additional references, such as Composition.author, Composition.encounter etc.\n\n* Servers MAY allow clients to redirect any attempts to find matches to another endpoint. This is especially helpful, \nwhen the $generate-metadata operation is provided by a third party other than the document's intended destination server.\n\n* Servers MAY offer additional mapping services for non-fhir-documents although these may need more advanced mapping/business logic,\nterminology mapping services and more complex patient matching. If they offer additional non-fhir mapping capabilities, \nServers SHOULD expose a derived OperationDefinition in their CapabilityStatment, which clearly defines the acceptable `non-fhir-document-types`.\n\n* Clients SHOULD populate `non-fhir-document-type` with a code acceptable to the server, when submitting `non-fhir-document`s\n",
